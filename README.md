Neural network simulation of respiratory rhythm generation.

Requires NEURON simulation software (http://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). The model is associated with the paper:

Fietkiewicz C, Loparo KA, Wilson CG (2011) Drive latencies in hypoglossal motoneurons indicate developmental change in the brainstem respiratory network. J Neural Eng 8:065011 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1741-2560/8/6/065011)

Creates raster plots similar to Figure 11 or Figure 13 in the paper.

USAGE NOTES:
1. Install NEURON.
2. Compile .mod files.
3. Run either figure11.hoc or figure13.hoc to recreate raster plots similar to Figure 11 or Figure 13, respectively, from the paper.
